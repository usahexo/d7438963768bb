An Audiologist is a professional who diagnoses and treats individuals with hearing loss or balance problems. They may work with people of all ages, from babies to the elderly. Audiologists perform a variety of tests to determine the nature and extent of an individual's hearing loss.

Some audiologists also pursue doctoral degrees for more specialized work.

#  Trump Administration Targets Online Gambling

The Trump administration is planning to crack down on online gambling, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The crackdown would involve new legislation that would make it more difficult for companies to offer online gambling services.

It’s not clear why the Trump administration is targeting online gambling, but the move is sure to be popular with conservative lawmakers and groups who have long opposed expansion of gambling.

The planned crackdown was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said that the new legislation would make it more difficult for companies to offer online gambling services. It’s not clear why the Trump administration is targeting online gambling, but the move is sure to be popular with conservative lawmakers and groups who have long opposed expansion of gambling.

In a statement, the Department of Justice said that it is “committed to enforcing the law and protecting American consumers.”

Online gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, with an estimated $4.5 billion being wagered online in 2016. Federal law prohibits most forms of online gambling, but there are some exceptions for states that have legalized internet poker or casino games.

The planned crackdown would likely involve new legislation from Congress that would clarify which forms of online gambling are legal. Such a bill could face strong opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who support deregulation.

Even if such a bill were to pass Congress, it would still need to be signed by President Trump, who has been a vocal supporter of expanded gambling rights. In 2002, Trump testified before a Congressional committee in support of legalizing internet poker.

#  AG Sessions: Time to End Unauthorized Online Gambling

Attorney General Jeff Sessions is renewing the call for Congress to pass a bill outlawing most online gambling.

Sessions, in a speech to a casino industry conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, said the Justice Department was “committed to stopping illegal gambling.”

“Congress has the ability to protect Americans from online gambling and we will do everything possible to make sure that happens,” he said.

The remarks were similar to those Sessions made in July, when he called on Congress to “restore integrity” to gambling laws.

Casino interests have been pushing for such a law for years, arguing that legalizing and regulating online gambling would put them at a disadvantage against unregulated offshore websites. But opponents of such a law say it would infringe on the rights of states and people who enjoy playing poker or other games online from their homes.

Sessions, who served as a senator from Alabama before becoming attorney general, has long been an opponent of legalized gambling. As attorney general, he has directed Justice Department officials to increase their efforts against illegal gaming operations.

#  Pennsylvania Authorizes Online Gambling

On October 30, 2017, Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the US to authorize online gambling. The state’s Gaming Control Board unanimously voted in favor of the measure, which will allow casinos in the state to offer online poker, slots, and other casino games to players within Pennsylvania’s borders.

The Board’s vote was seen as a major victory for gambling proponents in Pennsylvania, who have been seeking to legalize online gambling for years. Gambling opponents had argued that the move could lead to increased addiction and social problems, but the Board ultimately decided that the potential benefits of regulated online gambling outweighed the risks.

In announcing the decision, Board Chairman William Hayman said that “the legalization of internet gaming is recognition by this board that technology has changed since 2004 when casino gaming was authorized via the internet. It is also a recognition that Pennsylvanians are traveling to other states to engage in internet gaming.”

Under the new rules, casinos in Pennsylvania will be able to partner with licensed offshore operators to offer their games to players within the state. Players will be able to access casino games through desktop computers and mobile devices, and will be able to make deposits and withdrawals through approved payment processors.

The approval of online gambling in Pennsylvania comes at a time of growing momentum for legalized online gaming in the United States. In addition to Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware all offer some form of legal online gambling, while several other states are considering similar measures.

#  Nevada Regulators Approve New Online Gambling Regulations

The Nevada Gaming Commission has given its unanimous approval to new regulations that will pave the way for legal and licensed online gambling in the state. The vote came on Wednesday, January 8th, and the new rules are now set to take effect on March 1st.

The regulations were drawn up by the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), with the aim of creating a safe and secure environment for players while also protecting the interests of casinos and other gaming businesses in the state.

One of the key aspects of the new regulations is that they will require all online gambling providers to have a physical presence in Nevada. This means that companies such as PokerStars, which does not currently have a license to operate in Nevada, will not be able to offer their services to players in the state.

Tom Seitz, an attorney with Arnstein & Lehr who specializes in gambling law, told local media that this could be a problem for PokerStars. «There are a lot of people who play online poker, and if PokerStars can’t serve them from withinNevada then they may just go somewhere else,» he said.

Another key aspect of the new regulations is that they stipulate that all online gambling providers must use geolocation technology to verify the location of their players. This means that players will only be able to gamble on websites that are licensed in Nevada and that are accessible from within the state.

The NGCB has also released a set of guidelines for operators who wish to obtain a license to offer online gambling in Nevada. The guidelines cover areas such as age verification, responsible gaming measures, and security controls.

According to regulator chairman A.G. Burnett, one of the main reasons for introducing the new regulations is to protect Nevadans from being scammed or exploited by unlicensed operators. «These regulations raise the bar for operators wanting to conduct business inNevadaand ensure that our known and respected casino industry remains unscathed by unregulated activity,» he said.

The arrival of regulated online gambling in Nevada is good news for operators such as Caesars Entertainment Corporation and MGM Resorts International, both of which have recently obtained licenses for online casino operations in New Jersey. These companies are likely to be among the first to apply for licenses in Nevada once the new regulations come into effect on March 1st.

#  Delaware Signs Agreement for Interstate Online Poker

On Thursday, Delaware became the first US state to sign an interstate agreement for online poker. The agreement was finalized by Governor Jack Markell and Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf.

The multi-state agreement will allow for licensed and regulated online poker rooms that operate between the two states. Players in both states will be able to participate in the same games and tournaments.

Pennsylvania is expected to launch its online poker room in early 2018. Delaware launched its own online poker room in 2013, but it has been limited to players within the state. The new agreement is expected to greatly increase the player pool and create new opportunities for Delaware players.

Governor Jack Markell said, "This agreement is a great example of what can happen when states collaborate with each other to find innovative ways to improve services for our residents. I'm proud that Delaware is leading the way on this important issue."

Governor Tom Wolf added, "This partnership with Delaware will create jobs and economic growth in Pennsylvania by licensing and regulating online poker. It also allows us to share our best practices with Delaware, who has years of experience operating a successful online poker site."

Slot machines are always popular with casino goers, but this latest development is sure to see even more people flocking to try their luck on the 3 Card Poker game.

The aim of the game is to make the best hand possible using any combination of three cards from a seven-card deck.

There are various betting options available in 3 Card Poker, including simple betting on whether your hand will be better than that of the dealer, or betting on whether you will qualify for a bonus payout (if your hand is better than that of the dealer, and there are at least two other players at the table). The latter option can be especially lucrative if you manage to land a royal flush.

The 3 Card Poker Slot machine offers all of these same betting options, plus an extra bonus game that allows players to bet on individual cards. This extra game can be very lucrative if played correctly, and can add an extra layer of excitement to an already thrilling experience.

Whether you’re new to poker or an experienced player, 3 Card Poker is definitely worth giving a try. With beautiful graphics and exciting gameplay, it’s sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.

#  Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook All in the Running to Purchase Online Gaming Firm

It is being reported that Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook are all in the running to purchase the online gaming firm, Interactive Entertainment or I.E. for short.

I.E. is a gaming company that was started in 1995 and has become one of the leading online gaming companies in the world. I.E. operates a number of popular gaming sites including pogo.com, addictinggames.com and freeonlinegames.com.

The company is said to be up for sale for around $1 billion and it is unclear which company will emerge as the victor in the bidding war.

All of the tech giants are likely interested in I.E. for a variety of reasons. For Google, owning I.E would give them control of a major player in the online gaming space and would help them better compete with rivals like Amazon and Microsoft.

For Amazon, acquiring I.E would give them access to a large library of popular online games that they could then offer to their Prime customers as part of their subscription service.

Microsoft is no doubt interested in I.E as they continue to build out their Xbox gaming platform and adding popular games from I.E would only help strengthen their position in the market place.

Apple is likely eyeing I.E because they see gaming as an important growth area for them and believe that by acquiring I.E they can bring more gamers into their ecosystem and sell more devices to them in the process.

And finally, Facebook is interested in I.E because they see gaming as an important area of growth for them and believe that through acquisition they can quickly gain ground on rivals like Apple and Microsoft in this space

#  Chinese Conglomerate Leads Race to Buy Out Internet Casino Gambling Company

Casino gambling is a popular pastime for people all over the world. In some countries, it is considered a criminal activity, while in others it is a regulated and licensed industry. The internet has made it possible for people to gamble from the comfort of their own homes, and there are now hundreds of online casinos available to players.

The market for online casino gambling is estimated to be worth $49 billion, and it is growing rapidly. There are a number of big players in the industry, including Playtech, 888 Holdings, and Ladbrokes Coral. Now a Chinese conglomerate has entered the race to buy out one of the leading internet casino gambling companies.

Hainan Airlines Co., Ltd., which is part of the HNA Group, has made a bid to acquire 100% of shares in Australian company Crown Resorts Ltd. Crown Resorts is one of the largest operators of casinos in the world, with 17 resorts in Australia, Macau, and Las Vegas. It had revenue of $4.7 billion last year.

The offer from Hainan Airlines values Crown Resorts at $9 billion, but there is no guarantee that it will be accepted by shareholders. The offer represents a premium of 62% over the current share price.

HNA Group already has a presence in the online casino gambling market through its subsidiary Fly Casino. The group is seeking to expand its operations into other regions, including Europe and North America. Acquiring Crown Resorts would give it a significant foothold in the Australian market.

Crown Resorts has been hit hard by recent Chinese government restrictions on overseas tourism. This has led to a sharp decline in profits from its Macau operations. As a result, the company has been looking for a buyer since earlier this year.

Other potential buyers include gaming companies Las Vegas Sands Corp and MGM Resorts International, as well as private equity firms KKR & Co LP and TPG Capital LP. However, HNA Group appears to be the frontrunner at this stage.

            <h1 id="Soaring-Eagle-Casino-to-Have-1-000-Slot-Machines"><a href="#Soaring-Eagle-Casino-to-Have-1-000-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Soaring Eagle Casino to Have 1,000 Slot Machines!"></a>Soaring Eagle Casino to Have 1,000 Slot Machines!</h1><p>One of the most popular casinos in Michigan, Soaring Eagle Casino is about to get even more popular!

<h1 id="Soaring-Eagle-Casino-to-Triple-Size-of-Gambling-Floor"><a href="#Soaring-Eagle-Casino-to-Triple-Size-of-Gambling-Floor" class="headerlink" title="Soaring Eagle Casino to Triple Size of Gambling Floor!"></a>Soaring Eagle Casino to Triple Size of Gambling Floor!</h1><p>The Soaring Eagle Casino in Mount Pleasant, Michigan is set to triple the size of its gambling floor in order to keep up with competition from other casinos in the state.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from The Morning Sun, the casino plans to add on an extra 88,000 square feet of gambling space, which will bring the total floor space up to nearly 298,000 square feet.</p>
<p>This comes as no surprise considering that competition among Michigan’s casinos has been heating up in recent years. In 2018, for example, two new casinos opened up in Michigan - the Little River Casino and Resort in Manistee and the FireKeepers Casino Hotel in Battle Creek. These two casinos have taken a chunk out of the Soaring Eagle’s business, prompting the casino to expand its operations.</p>
<p>In addition to tripling the size of its gambling floor, the Soaring Eagle also plans to add a new hotel tower with 250 rooms, as well as a new spa and fitness center. This expansion is expected to cost upwards of $250 million and is scheduled to be completed by 2021.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of only a handful of states that offer full-service casino gambling. There are currently 29 casinos operating in Michigan, including The Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort.</p>

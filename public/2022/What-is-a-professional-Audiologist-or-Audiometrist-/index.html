They may also be involved in education, research and audiology administration. Audiologists typically have a 4-year bachelor’s degree in audiology, followed by a 2-3 year master’s degree program. Some audiologists also pursue doctoral degrees for more specialized work. </p>
<p>Audiometrists are a type of Audiologist who specialize in the measurement and assessment of human hearing ability.

Kiron Elementary is one of the recipients of the donation, and it’s going to help them immensely.</p>
<p>The school is getting new computers, a new playground, and new buses. The staff is also getting a raise, and everyone is obviously very excited about it.</p>
<p>It’s awesome to see such a big donation go to a school that really needs it. The students at Kiron Elementary are going to be able to learn in proper conditions now, and they’ll be able to have some fun outside as well.</p>
<p>This just goes to show that the Chickasaw Nation really cares about its people. It’s great that they were able to donate so much money to this school, and hopefully, they will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-Casino-Donates-To-Kiron-Elementary"><a href="#Oklahoma-Casino-Donates-To-Kiron-Elementary" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma Casino Donates To Kiron Elementary"></a>Oklahoma Casino Donates To Kiron Elementary</h1><p>The Choctaw Casino and Resort in Durant, Oklahoma has donated $10,000 to Kiron Elementary School. The money will be used to help fund the school’s music program.</p>
<p>Kiron Elementary School is a small school located in rural western Iowa. The school has just over 100 students in grades Pre-K through 8th grade. The music program at Kiron Elementary School is important to the students and the community.</p>
<p>“The music program is very important to us,” said Principal Lisa Vogel. “The kids really enjoy it and the parents appreciate the extra enrichment it provides.”</p>
<p>The Choctaw Casino and Resort is one of the largest employers in Durant, Oklahoma. The casino has been a generous supporter of various local organizations and causes.</p>
<h1 id="Elementary-School-In-Iowa-Gets-A-Boost-From-Oklahoma-Casino"><a href="#Elementary-School-In-Iowa-Gets-A-Boost-From-Oklahoma-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Elementary School In Iowa Gets A Boost From Oklahoma Casino"></a>Elementary School In Iowa Gets A Boost From Oklahoma Casino</h1><p>The Ponca Nation of Oklahoma is giving back to the local community with a $1 million donation to the elementary school in Iowa. The donation is being made through the tribe’s casino, and it’s the largest single donation that the school has ever received.</p>
<p>The money will be used to help pay for a new gym, as well as other updates and improvements to the school. The donation will also help to fund scholarships for students who attend the school.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for this incredibly generous donation from the Ponca Nation of Oklahoma,” said Superintendent Morrie Veide. “This will make such a positive impact on our students and our school community. We are truly blessed.”</p>
<p>The Ponca Nation has a long history of giving back to the local communities where its casinos are located. In addition to this recent donation to the elementary school in Iowa, the tribe has also donated money to local fire departments, animal shelters, and other organizations.</p>

The donation was made as part of the casino’s community outreach program.</p>
<p>Geisler Elementary School is a Title 1 school, which means that more than 40% of the students receive free or reduced-price lunch. The school is also in a rural area, where many families face economic hardship.</p>
<p>The new library will be used by all of the students at Geisler Elementary School. It will include books and other materials to help with reading and learning.</p>
<p>The principal of Geisler Elementary School, Jenni Huls, said that the new library is a “game changer” for the school. She thanked the casino for its generosity.</p>

The casino opened its doors in 2006 and has since become one of the most popular casinos in Oklahoma. The casino is owned and operated by the Chickasaw Nation.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes the Riverwind Casino so special is its commitment to giving back to the community. The casino offers numerous charitable programs that help benefit local organizations and individuals.</p>
<p>One of the main charitable programs offered by the casino is its Poker Tournament Series. This program raises money for various charities throughout Oklahoma. In 2017, the Poker Tournament Series raised over $300,000 for charity. Some of the charities that have benefited from this program include Rebuilding Together OKC, Food for Kids OKC, and Wheeler Arts Center.</p>
<p>The casino also sponsors several major events each year that raise money for local charities. One such event is the annual Charity Golf Classic. This event attracts golfers from all over Oklahoma and raises money for local charities that support children’s health and welfare. In 2018, the Charity Golf Classic raised over $100,000 for charity.</p>
<p>The Riverwind Casino also supports numerous other local charities through donations and sponsorships. These charities include but are not limited to: American Heart Association, American Red Cross, Boy Scouts of America, Girls Scouts of America, Habitat for Humanity, Junior Achievement, Special Olympics Oklahoma, and YWCA Oklahoma City.</p>
